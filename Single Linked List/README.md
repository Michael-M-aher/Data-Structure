# Singly Linked List

## Brief
It is the simplest type of linked list in which every node contains some data and a pointer to the next node of the same data type. The node contains a pointer to the next node means that the node stores the address of the next node in the sequence. 

## :hourglass: Complexity

| Operation     | Average       | Worst case   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Space         | **O(1)**      | **O(1)**     |
| Access        | **O(n)**  | **O(n)** |
| Insert at head        | **O(1)**  | **O(1)** |
| Insert at tail        | **O(1)**  | **O(1)** |
| Search        | **O(n)**  | **O(n)** |
| Remove at head        | **O(1)**  | **O(1)** |
| Remove in middle        | **O(n)**  | **O(n)** |
| Remove at tail        | **O(n)**  | **O(n)** |


## Operations

1. `list()` - creates a new empty Single Linked List.
1. `list(value, size)` - creates a new Single Linked List with size and value specified.
1. `push_front(value)` - inserts a new element into the front of the list.
1. `push_back(value)` - inserts a new element into the back of the list.
1. `insert(iterator, value)` - inserts a new element into the iterator location in the list.
1. `pop_front()` - delete the element at the front of the list.
1. `pop_back()` - delete the element at the back of the list.
1. `Remove(iterator)` - delete the element at the iterator location in the list.
1. `search(value)` - returns iterator location with the value specified.
1. `clear()` - clear the list.
1. `size()` - return the size of the list.
1. `front()` - return the element at the front of the list.
1. `back()` - return the element at the back of the list.
1. `begin()` - returns iterator of the first element in the list.
1. `end()` - returns iterator of the end of the list.
1. `rbegin()` - returns iterator of the last element in the list.
1. `rend()` - returns iterator of the beginning of the list.
1. `list<type>::iterator()` - creates a new iterator.
1. `iterator ++,+=,--,==,!=` - all operations can be applied to the iterator.
